# 🍔 Kudu menu Frontend Web Design (SPA)

This project is a **frontend-only** implementation of a restaurant-style website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates modern web design practices, responsive layouts, and a simple **Single Page Application (SPA)** routing system.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**  
  Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using CSS Grid, Flexbox.

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**  
  Lightweight JavaScript routing using the URL hash (`#/route`) to dynamically swap content without reloading.

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**  
  Menu items and categories are stored in a JSON file (`dishes.json`) and rendered into the page via `<template>` cloning.

- **Clean Class Naming**  
  Uses a consistent and descriptive class naming convention (inspired by BEM) for maintainability.

- **Best-Practice File Organization**  


## ✨ Important Notes

- **It is  aDesign**  
  The header and footer links don't work because it is a design for menu only
